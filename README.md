# Programming Fundamentals – C++

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of **C++ programs** designed to strengthen understanding of **programming fundamentals**. The programs cover a wide range of topics including basic input/output, conditional statements, loops, functions, arrays, strings, matrices, recursion, and small real-world logic simulations.

The repository is ideal for:

* Beginners learning **C++**
* Students practicing **Programming Fundamentals**
* Quick reference for common logic-building problems

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each file in this repository is an **independent C++ program** focusing on a specific concept or problem. All files use the `.cpp` extension and can be compiled and run individually.

Examples of covered categories:

* **Basic I/O & Operators** (e.g., arithmetic, temperature conversion)
* **Conditional Logic** (if/else, grading systems, eligibility checks)
* **Loops & Patterns** (number patterns, pyramids, sequences)
* **Functions** (value exchange, modular logic)
* **Arrays & Matrices** (searching, sorting, transformations)
* **Strings** (vowel checks, palindrome detection, case conversion)
* **Recursion & Iterative Logic**
* **Mini Simulations** (ticketing systems, inventory, POS, analytics)
